        <h2>The kingdom of Stockhalla lived in harmony until Dwindle Bear cast a curse on the kingdom. The curse caused the villagers to sell most of their goods, disrupting Stockhalla’s’ wealth. A noble knight named Rising Bull encountered Dwindle Bear, but lost, failing to lift the curse. This battle is not one to face alone. You are a villager who has not fallen under Dwindle Bear’s curse. Help Rising Bull restore the kingdoms’ harmony by lifting Dwindle Bear’s curse.</h2>
